 * Two definitions are required for sparsemem:
 *
 * MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS: The number of physical address bits required
 *   to address the last byte of memory.
 *
 * SECTION_SIZE_BITS: The number of physical address bits to cover
 *   the maximum amount of memory in a section.
 *
 * Eg, if you have 2 banks of up to 64MB at 0x80000000, 0x84000000,
 * then MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS is 32, SECTION_SIZE_BITS is 26.
 *
 * Define these in your mach/memory.h.
